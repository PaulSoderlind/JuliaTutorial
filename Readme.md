Readme for JuliaTutorial
========================

This folder contains my Julia tutorials (aimed at students in finance and economics). 

*  Most files are jupyter notebooks. Click one of them to see it online. Sometimes it renders better if you activate the nbviewer (see the symbol in the upper right corner once you have opened the file).
*  To edit and run it online, use JuliaBox.com.
*  To edit and run it with your local Julia installation do the following: (a) start Julia; (b) cd(file location); (c) using IJulia; (d) notebook(dir=pwd()). You clearly need IJulia to be installed for this.
*  The subfolder Data contains some data sets used in the programs, while the subfolder Results is for output.


On the files:

1. The .jl files are functions uses in some of the notebooks

2. Tutorial_ChapterNumber_Topic.ipynb are (relatively) short notebooks organised around specific topics.

3. The current version is tested on Julia 0.6.0.
